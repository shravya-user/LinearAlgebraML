Linear algebra concepts using NumPy and Matplotlib.

Key topics include:
    Creating and displaying NumPy arrays.
    Calculating vector sizes and norms using numpy.linalg.norm.
    2D vector plotting with Matplotlib, including custom functions to draw arrows representing vectors.
    3D vector plotting with mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.
    Visualizing vector operations like addition and scaling, and drawing circles based on vector norms.

Libraries Used
    NumPy: For numerical operations and vector/matrix handling.
    Matplotlib: For 2D and 3D vector visualization.
    mpl_toolkits.mplot3d: For creating 3D plots.

NumPy Arrays:

    Creation and manipulation of one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.

    Example: Defining video frame data and vector quantities.

Vector Size and Norms:

    Measuring the number of elements in a vector.

    Calculating vector lengths (Euclidean norms) manually and using numpy.linalg.norm.

2D Vector Visualization:

    Plotting 2D vectors as points and arrows using Matplotlib.

    Custom plot_vector2d function designed to visualize vector direction and magnitude.

    Demonstrating vector addition by placing one vectorâ€™s origin at the tip of another.

    Drawing circles to represent vector norms and unit circles.

3D Vector Visualization:

    Definition of 3D vectors and visualization setup using mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.

    Custom plot_vectors3d function for plotting multiple vectors in 3D space using quivers (arrows).

Vector Normalization:

    Scaling vectors to unit length.

    Visualizing unit vectors on a unit circle in 2D space.
